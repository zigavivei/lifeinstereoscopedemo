13740--Harvesting Indian River Pineapples in Florida.
The Pineapple (Anassa sativa) is a native of the American tropics.  It is the only fruit of large value which did not originate in Asia.  it is called pineapple because of the resemblance of the fruit to the pine cone.  For a long time its cultivation was restricted to the Isle of Eleuthera in the Bahamas, though now it is found everywhere in the tropics, very considerable plantations being established in Southern Florida.   In Eng-land it is grown under glass.  The fruit is most fragrant and largely used as a des-sert.  It is also preserved in sugar or in brandy, and is a large and growing item in our commerce with the tropics.  New York is the chief market.  The plant is stemless, the fruit growing from the ground from a clump of thick, fleshy and spinous leaves.  It [i]s propagated by suckers or by the tuft on the top of the fruit.  It is a most uncomfortable crop to handle because of its hard spines, heavy gloves and leggings being required by the workmen.  the Florida crop, gath-ered when ripe enough to ship, is collected in baskets, carried on the packing shed to a narrow gauge railway., and shipped fresh to the northern market.  It is a large and growing industry.
We pass on through the Florida Straits and across the Gulf of Mexico to Mexico.

Anyone with a spark of feel[in]g [m]ust be im-pressed by a scene like this.

These are the terr[ib]le by-products of war : suffering, pain, mutilation; patients moaning, muttering in delirium; in sleep fighting their battles over, shouting, cursing or pathetically resigned, weak and h[e]lpless.
Here, in this fine hospital, every care was lavished upon the patient.  [Sy]mpathetic nurses ministered to his eve[ry] wan[t.]  Near the front it was often kill or cure; so many thousands waited the surgeons' hands.  In rows they [la]y upon the floor--he has no time for the refine-ments of his profession.  The nurses worked [t]o the limit od human endurance.  They hur-[r]ied from case to case and had little time for gentle administrations.
Here was to be found every appliance of modern medical science: operating rooms, X-Ray rooms, dental offices, diet kitchens, all co-ordinated to the single purpose of restor-ing health.  Marvelous results were obtained, wonderful operatrions performed, health re-stored were death seemed to have set his seal upo[n] the patient in advance.""

The Lone Star State made its symbol the ground plan of its building, and it must be said that the effect was beautiful as it was unique.  From a central, pentagonal, domed tower five wings extended, running to blunt points ending in loggias, each ornamented with two lofty Corinthian columns.  From point to point the distances were 234 feet, which gives an idea of the large size of the building.  The top of the dome, crowned by the statue of Liberty, was 144 feet above the ground.  The cost of erecting the building amounted to $45,000.  The architects succeeded admirably in adapting the style of the exterior to the general idea, certainly not an easy problem to solve.  The inner arrangement was distinguished by an abundance of light.  In the finishing of the rooms native woods and marbles were extensively used, and the five-pointed star was conspicuous as an elements of the decorations.

STARVED ROCK.
STARVED ROCK, La Salle County, Ills. near the foot of the rapids of the Illinois, is a perpendicular mass of lime and sandstone washed by the current at its base and elevated one hundred and fifty feet.  The di-ameter of its surface is about one hundred feet, with a slope extending to the adjoining bluff from which it alone is accessible.
Tradition says that after the Illinois Indian had killed the Pontiac, the great Indian chief of the northern Indians made war upon them.  A[b]and of the Illinois in attempting to escape, took shelter on this rock, which they soon made inaccessible to their enemies, and where they were closely besieged.  They had se-cured provisions, but their only resource for water was letting down vessels with bark ropes to the river.  The wiley besieger contrived to come in canoes under the rock and cut off their buckets by which means the unfortunate Illinois were starved to death.  Many years after, their bones were whitening on the summit.

9781--The Sphinx, Gizeh, Egypt
We are standing with our backs to the great Nile river, looking west.  Behind us, eight miles away across the river, is the city of Cairo.  Thus colossal figure before us is the oldest statue in the world.  The Arabs walking about on it give us some idea of its huge proportions, the face alone being al-most the height of an ordinary two-story house.  It [w]as carved out of solid rock, and was crouching here before the Pyramids were built.  Many conjectures are made as to its origin and meaning.  One is that the sphinx is a colossal image of the Egyptian deity, Harmachis, ""god of the morning,"" and of the king (unknown) who had it hewn.  It faces the est to greet the first rays of dawn.  Another states that it is supposed to represent King Amenemhet III., the great builder and the reformer of the prac-tice of irrigation, and that it is placed here to overlook the Nile forever.  Some think that if sufficient excavation were made there would be found here beneath a hundred feet of sand a necropolis of the kings of the second dynasty.
The face, which, according to olden tales, wore an expression ""of the softest beauty and the most winning peace,"" has been shot at and quite disfigured by fanatical Mohammedans.
The Great Pyramid is only a quarter of a mile away.  This one before us, very nearly as large, is the Second Pyramid or Pyramid of Cephren.  The pyramids were the mauso-leums of the rulers of Egypt about 4000 B.C. and were the highest expression of desire to secure a safe and imposing burial place amid the shifting, destroying sands of the desert.

Inundation of the Nile
The Nile is Egypt.  There are in Egypt now about 10,000,000 people, and so far as we know the population has not varied much from that figure for several thousand years.  Since most of the country is almost abso-lutely rainless the only hope for a food sup-ply is in fertilizing waters of the great river.  The summer rains in Abyssinia raise the level of the Nile in a great flood, the crest of the wave arriving in lower Egypt in Octo-ber.  It is a time of great rejoicing when the Nile begins to rise.  The high water record often shows over forty feet above low stage.  This covers the bottom lands all along the rover for a thousand miles, lays down a layer of silt, and as the flood subsides the crops are sowed into the mud, to grow through the winter months and to be harvested be-fore the flood comes again.  Wheat is the principal grain, though barley, maize, and millet produce large crops.  Of late sugar cane and cotton are receiving large attention.
The ribbon of green which the Nile makes through the desert will not average over seven miles across, in most of the course of the valley it is less than half that.  The total arable area of Egyot is only 12,000 square miles, or about the size of Maryland.  The English regime is doing marvels in increasing the acreage, the one great venture of the Assuan dam adding over a million acres to the productive area.
The greater part of the permanently irri-gated area is in the Delta, below Cairo.  All of this is recent development, and the initia-tion of it is due to the great Khedive Mo-hammed Ali, whose noble mosque we will now visit.
